STEP 1: DELETE ALL FILES
- Login to cPanel
- Go to File Manager
- Navigate to public_html
- DELETE everything currently there

STEP 2: UPLOAD THIS PACKAGE

- Upload ALL files to public_html folder:
  ✓ index.html (diagnostic page)
  ✓ hr-app.html (actual HR system)
  ✓ .htaccess (server configuration)  
  ✓ assets/ folder (with CSS and JS files)

STEP 3: SET PERMISSIONS
In cPanel File Manager, right-click each item:

- Permissions: 644
- Check: Owner Read+Write, Group Read, World Read

FOLDERS (assets/):

2. Check the file tests on diagnostic page

3. Click "Try HR App" to launch full system

If you still get 403 error on step 4.1, the issue is:
