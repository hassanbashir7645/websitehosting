# HR Management System - A2Hosting Deployment (Fixed)

## Quick Upload Guide for cPanel

### Step 1: Upload Files
1. Login to your A2Hosting cPanel
2. Open **File Manager**
3. Navigate to **public_html** folder
4. Upload ALL files from this package:
   - `index.html`
   - `.htaccess` 
   - `assets/` folder (with CSS and JS files inside)
   - `test-simple.html`

### Step 2: Set Permissions
In cPanel File Manager:
- Right-click `assets` folder → Permissions → Set to **755**
- Right-click `index.html` → Permissions → Set to **644**
- Right-click `.htaccess` → Permissions → Set to **644**

### Step 3: Test
1. Visit: `yourdomain.com/test-simple.html`
2. If both CSS and JavaScript show "✓", proceed to step 4
3. If any show "✗", check file uploads and permissions

### Step 4: Launch
Visit: `yourdomain.com` - Your HR system should now load!
